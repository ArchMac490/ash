# ash - Archie's Shell

## Why

I'm trying to learn operating system design, with intentions of doing some kind of Linux from Scratch (LFS) project in the future. This is *currently* a basic, basic, basic shell. I'll add some features to it in the near future.

## To Come

1. Navigation
2. Background Tasks
3. Pipes, IO Redirection
